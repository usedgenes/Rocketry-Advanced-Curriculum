# Rocketry Advanced Curriculum

This is a brief lesson plan for a 6 week intermediate rocketry class for middle to high schoolers. It is designed for a class size of around 10-15 people, with a $2500 budget in total. For the first two weeks, students will build a beginner rocket that fires B or C motors, and will learn the basic model rocketry principles such as how to use epoxy and using CAD to design parts. The second two weeks, students will build a low power rocket that fires D, E, or F motors, and will build on previous lessons and get introduced to things like using OpenRocket to simulate a rocket launch. The last two weeks, students will get introduced to the TARC competition and have the chance to build a TARC rocket that meets example requirements such as altitude and time in the air. 

To use the curriculum, simply download the repository, read over the lesson plans, and use the powerpoints as necessary
